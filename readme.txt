== Description ==

Backup is crucial to any business. Regular backup protects your data. [blogVault](http://blogvault.net?bvsrc=backup-plugin-readme) is a top-notch [WordPress backup](http://blogvault.net?bvsrc=backup-plugin-readme) plugin that creates daily automatic backups of your WordPress site. Backup plugin does complete WordPress backup including files and database backup.

Top Features:

* Daily Automatic Backup
* Real-time WordPress Backup
* Complete WordPress Backup - files backup and database backup
* WordPress Backup to Dropbox
* 30 day Backup history
* Easy restore from backup
* Easy migration from backup
* Managed offsite backup

= Easy Setup =
It takes only a few minutes to install the blogVault backup plugin. blogVault schedules daily backups and only uses offsite storage, so everything is automatically set up. The first WordPress backup is initiated immediately and you can view the progress of your backups from the blogVault dashboard.

= Complete WordPress Backup =
Backup Plugin does the complete backup of the WordPress site, including files and database. Many backup plugins only backup the database. This is not sufficient as all the images, themes, plugins, and other uploads are stored as files. Just doing the backup of database can hence lead to data loss at the time of restore. blogVault saves your complete WordPress site content including Posts, Pages, Plugin, Images, Comments, etc.

= Managed offsite backups =
Like in the case of any good wp backup plugin, blogVault creates offsite backups so that your content is safe even if your site goes down. It manages the backup archive and stores up to 30 wordpress backups at any point of time. The backups are stored in blogVault's own servers and then further copied to Amazon S3. Hence 9 copies of a WordPress backup are maintained across multiple independent data-centers.
Most other backup plugins store backups locally on the server. This puts additional load on the server and slows your site down. Not only that, this backup technique can quickly eat up all your server storage space if you have a limited storage plan. The blogVault backup plugin doesn’t use any local storage for your WordPress backups. Lastly, local backups are as good as no backups at all. If the server crashes then you will lose the WordPress site and the backups too.

= Easy Restore of Backups =
If your site gets hacked, blogVault's easy restore feature helps you get back on your feet swiftly. It automatically restores a specific WordPress backup onto the server.
blogVault also includes a test-restore feature using which you can test backups before deploying them onto the server or simply to verify the integrity of a WordPress backup version. The wp backup is temporarily restored on blogVault’s own servers so that you can validate the backup.

= Migration using Backup =
blogVault’s simple migration feature helps you move to a new domain or host seamlessly using backups. The chosen WordPress backup version is uploaded onto the new location with just a few clicks and your site is ready to be launched. Any version from the list of backups can be used for this. The migration takes place straight from the backup stored on the blogVault servers, hence not affecting the original site. blogVault does migrations in parts, and hence very large WordPress backups can be migrated easily.

= Securing your Backup =
blogVault provides the best security by maintaining multiple copies of WordPress backups on its own as well as Amazon S3 servers. This ensures redundancy of your wp backups. All your backups are encrypted and are hence 100% safe with us.
You can also use the backup to Dropbox feature and upload backups to your Dropbox account. This feature enables you to store chosen versions of your WordPress backup beyond the 30 days for which blogVault archives your backups.

= Incremental Backups =
Do you own large site that spans 10s of GB? Then regular backup plugins may not work for you. blogVault does a complete backup of your site the very first time. After this, only the changes since the last backup are picked up. This backup method, known as incremental backup, reduces the load on your server and the size of your backups.

= Real-time Backup =
With a regular backup plugin, there is a possibility of losing data even if you have daily scheduled backups. Sites that deal with e-commerce or news undergo multiple updates in a day. An outage in the middle of the day could spell doom. blogVault’s real-time backup ensures that any change is immediately saved with this instant backup. You no longer have to worry about losing a single transaction, even if your site crashes in between scheduled backups. blogVault also has special handling for wooCommerce sites which regular backup plugins can’t handle.

= WordPress Multisite(WPMU) Backup =
blogVault supports WordPress Multisite backups. The entire multi-site is backed up, migrated or restored. Some other services backup only a single subsite. However, we backup the entire network, hence reducing the possibility of any shared resource such as plugin or theme being lost.

= Backup Monitoring =
Does your backup plugin verify the integrity of your WordPress backups? blogVault monitors the scheduled backups and notifies you immediately when an issue arises with your backups.

= Backup History =
An easy way of managing WordPress backups is very essential for any backup plugin. Assuming that you take daily backups of your site, we are talking about 30 a month, 360 a year, and so on. A good history page that lists all the backups is very useful. However, if you want to look for a specific backup version, how do you do it? If you want to rollback your site to backup containing specific changes, is there a way?
blogVault’s history page includes all the details for each backup like list of plugins, number of posts, pages, files, and tables. Not only that, it also highlights the changes in a backup making it really easy to locate any specific updates. It also includes a screenshot for every backup which again enables you to find a particular backup with a single glance.

= Test-Restore your Backup =
blogVault provides a unique feature which lets you restore a backup temporarily on our test servers. This lets you validate the backup and ensure that the backup is perfect. It can also be used to identify the right backup to restore from in case you are reverting to an older backup.

= Support =
blogVault provides the best technical support in comparison to other wordpress backup plugins, using phone, email and chat. If you face any issues with backups, the support team is always ready to help.

= Backup Plans =
blogVault provides 3 different WordPress backup plans – basic, plus, and pro, to suit different backup needs. Whether you are a small time entrepreneur or a large company, blogVault puts an end to your data loss worries with these flexible backup plans. blogVault includes a 7 day free trial so that you can explore all the features of this backup plugin before committing to a specific backup plan.
Your WordPress backups are as valuable as your site itself. Without a good backup in place, you are a risk of losing everything when your site goes down. It is very important to choose a backup plugin that brings the best backup features and guaranteed support. The blogVault backup plugin is the best choice for you.
